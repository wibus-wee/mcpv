import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps'

This path assumes you want a headless deployment with config files. It uses the default layout: one config directory, one core process, and one gateway.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a config directory and add a YAML file with at least one server definition.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Validate the configuration so the core can load it.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start the core and point it at your config directory.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start the gateway and choose a routing mode.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Connect a client to the gateway and make a test call.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Minimal config example
Create a YAML file in your config directory, for example `runtime.yaml`:

```yaml
servers:
  - name: weather
    transport: stdio
    cmd: [node, ./path/to/server.js]
    tags: [chat]
    idleSeconds: 60
    maxConcurrent: 1
    strategy: stateless
    activationMode: on-demand
    protocolVersion: "2025-11-25"
```

## Validate and run
Validate your config, then start the core:

```bash
go run ./cmd/mcpv validate --config .
go run ./cmd/mcpv serve --config .
```

Start the gateway in one of two modes:

```bash
# Tag mode
go run ./cmd/mcpvmcp --tag chat

# Single-server mode
go run ./cmd/mcpvmcp --server weather
```

If your client can list tools successfully, the system is wired correctly.
