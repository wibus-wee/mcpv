MCPV exposes health and metrics endpoints so you can plug it into existing monitoring stacks. This keeps runtime visibility consistent with the rest of your infrastructure.

## Health checks
A simple health endpoint tells you whether the core is alive and responding. Use it for process supervision and readiness checks.

## Metrics
Metrics are exported in a Prometheus-compatible format. Track server counts, instance activity, and error rates without building custom instrumentation.

<Callout type="info" title="Default endpoints">
  Health is served at `/healthz` and metrics at `/metrics` on the core service.
</Callout>
