Most issues come down to three categories: configuration errors, process failures, or routing mismatches. The core and gateway are strict by design, so the fix is usually deterministic once you know where to look.

## The core will not start
Validate your configuration first. If validation fails, fix the reported field before retrying. If validation passes but the core exits, check for port conflicts or permission issues on the host.

```bash
go run ./cmd/mcpv validate --config .
```

## The gateway shows no tools
This almost always means the gateway is running but cannot see any matching servers. Check the server name in single-server mode, or confirm that client tags match server tags in tag mode.

## Servers start and stop repeatedly
Rapid restarts usually indicate a server process that fails after launch. Verify the command and working directory, then run the server manually outside MCPV to capture its own error output.

## Tools are missing or stale
Tools are aggregated from servers. If a tool is missing, confirm the server is reachable and has reported its tool list. A config reload or server restart usually forces a refresh.

  MCPV coordinates, but it cannot fix a broken server process. Start there when debugging.
