title: Gateway
description: One MCP endpoint, many servers.
---

The gateway is the only MCP endpoint your clients need. It looks like a single MCP server, but it routes requests to your real servers through the core. This keeps client configuration simple even when your catalog grows.

## Two routing modes
In single-server mode, the gateway always routes to one named server. In tag mode, the gateway exposes a filtered tool list based on client tags, which keeps clients focused and avoids accidental access to unrelated servers.

## Why the gateway exists
The gateway isolates clients from your internal topology. You can add or remove servers, change lifecycle settings, or adjust tags without touching client configuration.

## How to start it

```bash
# Tag mode
go run ./cmd/mcpvmcp --tag chat

# Single-server mode
go run ./cmd/mcpvmcp --server weather
```

If the gateway can list tools, routing is working.
