title: Reloading configuration
description: Apply changes safely without downtime.

The core watches the config directory for changes. When a file changes, MCPV reloads and updates routing. This gives you live updates without restarting the service.

## How reload works
Active instances continue to serve requests. New instances inherit the updated configuration. This means you can change tags, add servers, or adjust defaults without cutting off existing traffic.

## A safe workflow
Update your YAML, validate it, then let the core reload automatically. If you want to force a clean start, you can stop and restart the core after validation.

```bash
go run ./cmd/mcpv validate --config .
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid silent drift">
  Keep config in version control so reloads are traceable and reversible.
