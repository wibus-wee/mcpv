MCPV helps you run and organize Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with as little friction as possible. If you want the simplest experience, start with the UI. If you prefer to run everything headless or integrate into your own systems, head to the core + gateway section.

  If you are here to manage servers and see what is running, the UI is the right place. You can always move to the core section later.
