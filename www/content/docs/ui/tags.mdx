title: Tags and routing
description: Use tags to control visibility and keep tool lists clean.

Tags are the simplest way to shape routing. They let you decide which servers are visible to which clients, without changing the servers themselves.

Think of a tag as a lightweight contract. A client that asks for the "chat" tag should only see the servers you meant for chat. This keeps tool lists focused and reduces surprises.


## How MCPV uses tags
Tags live on server definitions and on clients. When a client connects with a tag, MCPV filters the exposed tools to only those servers with matching tags. The UI keeps this visible so you can reason about routing without digging into logs.


## A practical mental model
If you would not want a client to call every server, use tags. It is the smallest change with the biggest clarity boost.


## Naming that scales
Tags are just strings, so consistency matters. Pick short, readable names and stick to them. It is easier to grow a simple tag system than to clean up a messy one.

  Small tag sets are easier to maintain. You can always grow later when your server catalog expands.
