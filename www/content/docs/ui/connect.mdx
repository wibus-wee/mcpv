MCPV sits between your client and your servers. The UI makes the connection step explicit so you know exactly what address to use and what mode you are in.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the Connect dialog from the UI. It shows the current gateway address and whether you are in single-server mode or tag-based mode.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In your MCP client, add a new connection using the gateway address. Keep the name simple so it is easy to recognize later.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If you use tags, add the same tag in the client configuration. This is how MCPV decides which servers to expose.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Make a test call from the client. The server state in MCPV UI should move from idle to running and then settle back.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## What the gateway actually does
The gateway is the only address your client needs. It acts like a single MCP server, but behind the scenes it forwards requests to the right backend server based on name or tag. This gives you a clean client configuration even when you have many servers.


## What the client sees
In single-server mode, the client always sees one server and its tools. In tag mode, the gateway exposes a filtered tool list that matches the client tag. That keeps clients focused and prevents accidental cross-use.

<Callout type="info" title="Tag mode or single server?">
  Use a tag when you want one client to access a group of servers. Use single-server mode when you want a strict, one-to-one connection.
